The right hand margin is reserved for the examiner’s use and nothing should be written there.

On no account should your script be handed over to a peon or an attendant.\n (xii)  If it becomes necessary for you to speak to the Supervisor or an \nInvigilator, or if you need stationery, remain in your seat and raise your hand.\nCommissioner General of Examinations, Department of Examinations,\nPelawat ta, Battaramulla.\n\n<!-- page 4 -->\n\n I fldgi : (IIw) fPoh    ‑ YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha .eiÜ m;%h ‑ 2018'01'05\n P ART  I :  S EC.
