Guidelines on Consumption of Inputs in the Production\nProcess—\n(1) Indirect tax rebate schemes can allow for exemption,\nremission or deferral of prior-stage cumulative indirecttaxes levied on inputs that are consumed in the productionof the exported product  (making normal allowance forwaste).\n(2) Similarly, drawback schemes can allow for the remission\nor drawback of import charges levied in inputs that areconsumed in the production of the exported product(making normal allowance for waste).\n(3) The Illustrative List of Export Subsidies specified in item 1\nof this Schedule, makes reference to the term “inputs that\nare consumed in the production of the exported product”in paragraphs ( h) and ( i). Pursuant to paragraph ( h), indirect\ntax rebate schemes can constitute an export subsidy to theextent that they result in exemption, remission or deferralof prior-stage cumulative indirect taxes in excess of the\namount of such taxes actually levied on inputs that are\nconsumed in the production of the exported product.Pursuant to paragraph ( i), drawback schemes can constitute\nan export subsidy to the extent that they result in a remissionor drawback of import charges in excess of those actuallylevied on inputs that are consumed in the production of the\nexported product. Both paragraphs stipulate that normal\nallowance for waste must be made in findings regardingconsumption of inputs in the production of the exportedproduct. Paragraph ( i) also provides for substitution, where\nappropriate.\n(4) In examining whether inputs are consumed in the\nproduction of the exported product, as part of a\n\n<!-- page 78 -->\n\nAnti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties 77\ncountervailing duty investigation conducted under Part II\nof this Act, the Director-General shall proceed on the\nfollowing basis:—\n(a) where it is alleged that an indirect tax rebate\nscheme, or a drawback scheme, conveys a subsidyby reason of over-rebate or excess drawback ofindirect taxes or import charges on inputs consumedin the production of the exported product, theDirector-General shall first determine whether thegovernment of the exporting Member has in placeand applies a system or procedure to confirm whichinputs are consumed in the production of theexported product and in what amounts. Wheresuch a system or procedure is determined to beapplied, the Director-General shall then examinethe system or procedure to see whether it isreasonable, effective for the purpose intended, andbased on generally accepted commercial practicesin the country of export. The Director-Generalmay, in accordance with section 33 of this Act,carry out certain practical tests in order to verifyinformation or to satisfy itself that the system orprocedure is being effectively applied;\n(b) where there is no such system or procedure, where\nit is not reasonable, or where it is instituted andconsidered reasonable but is found not to be appliedor not to be applied effectively, a furtherexamination by the exporting Member based onthe actual inputs involved would need to be carriedout in the context of determining whether an excesspayment occurred. If the Director-General deemsit necessary, a further examination may be carriedout in accordance with paragraph ( a);\n(c) the Director-General shall treat inputs as physically\nincorporated if such inputs are used in theproduction process and are physically present inthe product exported. The Members note that aninput need not be present in the final product inthe same form in which it entered the  productionprocess;\n(d) in determining the amount of a particular input\nthat is consumed in the production of the exportedproduct, a “normal allowance for waste” shall betaken into account, and such waste shall be treatedas consumed in the production of the exported\n\n<!-- page 79 -->\n\n78 Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties\nproduct. The term “waste” refers to that portion of\na given input which does not serve an independentfunction in the production process, is not consumedin the production of the exported product (forreasons such as inefficiencies) and is not recovered,used or sold by the same manufacturer;\n(e) the Director-General’s determination of whether\nthe claimed allowance for waste is “normal” shalltake into account the production process, theaverage experience of the industry in the countryof export, and other technical factors, asappropriate. The Director-General shall bear inmind that an important question is whether theauthorities in the exporting Member, havereasonably calculated the amount of waste, whensuch an amount is intended to be included in thetax or duty rebate or remission.\n3. Guidelines in the Determination of Substitution Drawback\nSystems as Export Subsidies—\n(1) Drawback systems can allow for the refund or drawback of\nimport charges on inputs which are consumed in theproduction process of another product, and where the exportof this latter product contains domestic inputs having thesame quality and characteristics as those substituted for theimported inputs. Pursuant to paragraph ( i) of the Illustrative\nList of Export Subsidies specified in this Schedule,substitution drawback systems can constitute an exportsubsidy to the extent that they result in an excess drawbackof the import charges levied initially on the imported inputsfor which drawback is being claimed.\n(2) In examining any substitution drawback system as part of a\ncountervailing duty investigation conducted under Part IIof this Act, the Director-General shall proceed on thefollowing  basis :—\n(a) paragraph ( i) of the Illustrative List of Export\nSubsidies specified in the Schedule, stipulates thathome market inputs may be substituted for importedinputs in the production of a product for export,provided such inputs are equal in quantity to, andhave the same quality and characteristics as, theimported inputs being substituted. The existence ofa verification system or procedure is important,because it enables the government of the exportingMember to ensure and demonstrate that the quantity\n\n<!-- page 80 -->\n\nAnti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties 79\nof inputs for which drawback is claimed does not\nexceed the quantity of similar products exported, inwhatever form, and that there is not drawback ofimport charges in excess of those originally leviedon the imported inputs in question;\n(b) where it is alleged that a substitution drawback system\nconveys a subsidy, the Director-General shall firstproceed to determine whether the government ofthe exporting Member has in place and applies averification system or procedure. Where such asystem or procedure is determined to be applied, theDirector-General shall then examine the verificationprocedures to see whether they are reasonable,effective for the purpose intended, and based ongenerally accepted commercial practices in thecountry of export. To the extent that the proceduresare determined to meet this test and are effectivelyapplied, no subsidy shall be presumed to exist. TheDirector-General may in accordance with section 33of this Act, carry out certain practical tests in orderto verify information or to satisfy itself that theverification procedures are being effectively applied;\n(c) where there are no verification procedures, or where\nthey are not reasonable, or where such proceduresare instituted and considered reasonable but arefound not to be actually applied or not appliedeffectively, there may be a subsidy. In such cases, afurther examination by the exporting Member, basedon the actual transactions involved would need tobe carried out to determine whether an excesspayment occurred. If the Director-General deems itnecessary, a further examination would be carriedout in accordance with paragraph ( b) ;\n(d) the existence of a substitution drawback provision\nunder which exporters are allowed to select particularimport shipments on which drawback is clamed,shall not of itself be considered to convey a subsidy;\n(e) an excess drawback of import charges in the sense\nof paragraph ( i) of the Illustrative List of Export\nSubsidies specified in this Schedule, shall be deemedto exist, where governments paid interest on anymoneys refunded under their drawback schemes, to\nthe extent of the  interest actually paid or payable.\n\n<!-- page 81 -->\n\n80 Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties\nAnnual subscription of English Bills and Acts of the Parliament Rs. 885 (Local), Rs. 1,180\n(Foreign), Payable to the S UPERINTENDENT , G OVERNMENT  PUBLICATIONS  BUREAU , D EPARTMENT  OF\nGOVERNMENT  INFORMATION , NO. 163, K IRULAPONA  MAWATHA , POLHENGODA , COLOMBO  05 before 15th\nDecember each year in respect of the year following ."

for the like product exportedto any appropriate third country, provided that suchprice shall be representative; or\n(b) the cost of production of such product including\nadministrative, selling and general costs in theexporting country, plus a reasonable amount forprofits.\n(2) For the purpose of subsection (1), sales of like product\ndestined for consumption in the domestic market of theexporting country or the appropriate third country, shallnormally be considered to be a sufficient quantity for thedetermination of the normal value, if such sales constitutefive per centum  or

Guidelines on Consumption of Inputs in the Production\nProcess —\n(1) Indirect tax rebate schemes can allow for exemption,\nremission or deferral of prior-stage cumulative indirecttaxes levied on inputs that are consumed in the productionof the exported product  (making normal allowance forwaste).\n(2) Similarly, drawback schemes can allow for the remission\nor drawback of import charges levied in inputs that areconsumed in the production of the exported product(making normal allowance for waste).\n(3) The Illustrative List of Export Subsidies specified in item 1\nof this Schedule, makes reference to the term “inputs that\nare consumed in the production of the exported product”in paragraphs ( h) and ( i). Pursuant to paragraph ( h), indirect\ntax rebate schemes can constitute an export subsidy to theextent that they result in exemption, remission or deferralof prior-stage cumulative indirect taxes in excess of the\namount of such taxes actually levied on inputs that are\nconsumed in the production of the exported product.Pursuant to paragraph ( i), drawback schemes can constitute\nan export subsidy to the extent that they result in a remissionor drawback of import charges in excess of those actuallylevied on inputs that are consumed in the production of the\nexported product. Both paragraphs stipulate that normal\nallowance for waste must be made in findings regardingconsumption of inputs in the production of the exportedproduct. Paragraph ( i) also provides for substitution, where\nappropriate.\n(4) In examining whether inputs are consumed in the\nproduction of the exported product, as part of a\n\n<!-- page 82 -->\n\nAnti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties 77\ncountervailing duty investigation conducted under Part II\nof this Act, the Director-General shall proceed on the\nfollowing basis:—\n(a) where it is alleged that an indirect tax rebate\nscheme, or a drawback scheme, conveys a subsidyby reason of over-rebate or excess drawback ofindirect taxes or import charges on inputs consumedin the production of the exported product, theDirector-General shall first determine whether thegovernment of the exporting Member has in placeand applies a system or procedure to confirm whichinputs are consumed in the production of theexported product and in what amounts. Wheresuch a system or procedure is determined to beapplied, the Director-General shall then examinethe system or procedure to see whether it isreasonable, effective for the purpose intended, andbased on generally accepted commercial practicesin the country of export. The Director-Generalmay, in accordance with section 33 of this Act,carry out certain practical tests in order to verifyinformation or to satisfy itself that the system orprocedure is being effectively applied;\n(b) where there is no such system or procedure, where\nit is not reasonable, or where it is instituted andconsidered reasonable but is found not to be appliedor not to be applied effectively, a furtherexamination by the exporting Member based onthe actual inputs involved would need to be carriedout in the context of determining whether an excesspayment occurred. If the Director-General deemsit necessary, a further examination may be carriedout in accordance with paragraph ( a);\n(c) the Director-General shall treat inputs as physically\nincorporated if such inputs are used in theproduction process and are physically present inthe product exported. The Members note that aninput need not be present in the final product inthe same form in which it entered the  productionprocess;\n(d) in determining the amount of a particular input\nthat is consumed in the production of the exportedproduct, a “normal allowance for waste” shall betaken into account, and such waste shall be treatedas consumed in the production of the exported\n\n<!-- page 83 -->\n\n78 Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties\nproduct. The term “waste” refers to that portion of\na given input which does not serve an independentfunction in the production process, is not consumedin the production of the exported product (forreasons such as inefficiencies) and is not recovered,used or sold by the same manufacturer;\n(e) the Director-General’s determination of whether\nthe claimed allowance for waste is “normal” shalltake into account the production process, theaverage experience of the industry in the countryof export, and other technical factors, asappropriate. The Director-General shall bear inmind that an important question is whether theauthorities in the exporting Member, havereasonably calculated the amount of waste, whensuch an amount is intended to be included in thetax or duty rebate or remission.\n3. Guidelines in the Determination of Substitution Drawback\nSystems as Export Subsidies —\n(1) Drawback systems can allow for the refund or drawback of\nimport charges on inputs which are consumed in theproduction process of another product, and where the exportof this latter product contains domestic inputs having thesame quality and characteristics as those substituted for theimported inputs. Pursuant to paragraph ( i) of the Illustrative\nList of Export Subsidies specified in this Schedule,substitution drawback systems can constitute an exportsubsidy to the extent that they result in an excess drawbackof the import charges levied initially on the imported inputsfor which drawback is being claimed.\n(2) In examining any substitution drawback system as part of a\ncountervailing duty investigation conducted under Part IIof this Act, the Director-General shall proceed on thefollowing  basis:—\n(a) paragraph ( i) of the Illustrative List of Export\nSubsidies specified in the Schedule, stipulates thathome market inputs may be substituted for importedinputs in the production of a product for export,provided such inputs are equal in quantity to, andhave the same quality and characteristics as, theimported inputs being substituted. The existence ofa verification system or procedure is important,because it enables the government of the exportingMember to ensure and demonstrate that the quantity\n\n<!-- page 84 -->\n\nAnti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties 79\nof inputs for which drawback is claimed does not\nexceed the quantity of similar products exported, inwhatever form, and that there is not drawback ofimport charges in excess of those originally leviedon the imported inputs in question;\n(b) where it is alleged that a substitution drawback system\nconveys a subsidy, the Director-General shall firstproceed to determine whether the government ofthe exporting Member has in place and applies averification system or procedure. Where such asystem or procedure is determined to be applied, theDirector-General shall then examine the verificationprocedures to see whether they are reasonable,effective for the purpose intended, and based ongenerally accepted commercial practices in thecountry of export. To the extent that the proceduresare determined to meet this test and are effectivelyapplied, no subsidy shall be presumed to exist. TheDirector-General may in accordance with section 33of this Act, carry out certain practical tests in orderto verify information or to satisfy itself that theverification procedures are being effectively applied;\n(c) where there are no verification procedures, or where\nthey are not reasonable, or where such proceduresare instituted and considered reasonable but arefound not to be actually applied or not appliedeffectively, there may be a subsidy. In such cases, afurther examination by the exporting Member, basedon the actual transactions involved would need tobe carried out to determine whether an excesspayment occurred. If the Director-General deems itnecessary, a further examination would be carriedout in accordance with paragraph ( b);\n(d) the existence of a substitution drawback provision\nunder which exporters are allowed to select particularimport shipments on which drawback is claimed,shall not of itself be considered to convey a subsidy;\n(e) an excess drawback of import charges in the sense\nof paragraph ( i) of the Illustrative List of Export\nSubsidies specified in this Schedule, shall be deemedto exist, where governments paid interest on anymoneys refunded under their drawback schemes, to\nthe extent of the  interest actually paid or payable.\n\n<!-- page 85 -->\n\n80 Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties"
