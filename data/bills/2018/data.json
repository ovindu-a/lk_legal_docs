Carriage between two points within the\nterritory of a single State Party without an agreed stopping place within\nthe territory of another State is not international carriage for thepurposes of this Convention.\n3. Carriage to be performed by several successive carriers is deemed,\nfor the purposes of this Convention, to be one undivided carriage if it\nhas been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had\nbeen agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series ofcontracts, and it does not lose its international character merely becauseone contract or a series of contracts is to be performed entirely withinthe territory of the same State.\n4.

If any such other means is used, the carrier shalloffer to deliver to the passenger a written statement of the informationso preserved.\n3. The carrier shall deliver to the passenger a baggage identification\ntag for each piece of checked baggage.\n4. The passenger shall be given written notice to the effect that\nwhere this Convention is applicable it governs and may limit the liability\nof carriers in respect of death or injury and for destruction or loss of, or\ndamage to, baggage, and for delay.\n5. Non-compliance with the provisions of the foregoing paragraphs\nshall not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage,which shall, nonetheless, be subject to the rules of this Convention\nincluding those relating to limitation of liability.\nArticle 4 - Cargo\n1.

This provision creates for the carrier\nno duty, obligation or liability resulting therefrom.\nArticle 7 - Description of Air Waybill\n1. The air waybill shall be made out by the consignor in three\noriginal parts.\n2. The first part shall be marked “for the carrier”; it shall be\nsigned by the consignor. The second part shall be marked “for the\nconsignee”; it shall be signed by the consignor and by the carrier. The\nthird part shall be signed by the carrier who shall hand it to the consignorafter the cargo has been accepted.\n3.

Carriage between two points within the\nterritory of a single State Party without an agreed stopping place within\nthe territory of another State is not international carriage for thepurposes of this Convention.\n3. Carriage to be performed by several successive carriers is deemed,\nfor the purposes of this Convention, to be one undivided carriage if it\nhas been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had\nbeen agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series ofcontracts, and it does not lose its international character merely becauseone contract or a series of contracts is to be performed entirely withinthe territory of the same State.\n4. This Convention applies also to carriage as set out in Chapter\nV, subject to the terms contained therein.\nArticle 2 - Carriage Performed by State and Carriage of\nPostal Items\n1.

The carrier shall deliver to the passenger a baggage identification\ntag for each piece of checked baggage.\n4.

The consignormust not exercise this right of disposition in such a way as to prejudicethe carrier or other consignors and must reimburse any expensesoccasioned by the exercise of this right.\n2. If it is impossible to carry out the instructions of the consignor,\nthe carrier must so inform the consignor forthwith.\n3. If the carrier carries out the instructions of the consignor for\nthe disposition of the cargo without requiring the production of thepart of the air waybill or the cargo receipt delivered to the latter, the\ncarrier will be liable, without prejudice to its right of recovery from the\nconsignor, for any damage which may be caused thereby to any personwho is lawfully in possession of that part of the air waybill or the cargoreceipt.\n4. The right conferred on the consignor ceases at the moment\nwhen that of the consignee begins in accordance with Article 13.Nevertheless, if the consignee declines to accept the cargo, or cannotbe communicated with, the consignor resumes its right of disposition.\nArticle 13 - Delivery of the Cargo\n1. Except when the consignor has exercised its right under Article\n12, the consignee is entitled, on arrival of the cargo at the place ofdestination, to require the carrier to deliver the cargo to it, on paymentof the charges due and on complying with the conditions of carriage.\n2.

However, the carrier is notliable if and to the extent that the damage resulted from the inherent\ndefect, quality or vice of the baggage. In the case of unchecked baggage,\nincluding personal items, the carrier is liable if the damage resultedfrom its fault or that of its servants or agents.\n3. If the carrier admits the loss of the checked baggage, or if the\nchecked baggage has not arrived at the expiration of twenty-one days\nafter the date on which it ought to have arrived, the passenger is\nentitled to enforce against the carrier the rights which flow from thecontract of carriage.\n4.

If,\nhowever, such carriage takes place in the performance of a contract for\ncarriage by air, for the purpose of loading, delivery or transhipment,any damage is presumed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have been\nthe result of an event which took place during the carriage by air. If a\n\n<!-- page 12 -->\n\n11 Carriage by Air\ncarrier, without the consent of the consignor, substitutes carriage by\nanother mode of transport for the whole or part of a carriage intendedby the agreement between the parties to be carriage by air, such carriageby another mode of transport is deemed to be within the period ofcarriage by air.\nArticle 19 – Delay\nThe carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage\nby air of passengers, baggage or cargo. Nevertheless, the carrier shallnot be liable for damage occasioned by delay if it proves that it and itsservants and agents took all measures that could reasonably be requiredto avoid the damage or that it was impossible for it or them to take suchmeasures.\nArticle 20 – Exoneration\nIf the carrier proves that the damage was caused or contributed to by\nthe negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the person claimingcompensation, or the person from whom he or she derives his or herrights, the carrier shall be wholly or partly exonerated from its liabilityto the claimant to the extent that such negligence or wrongful act oromission caused or contributed to the damage. When by reason of deathor injury of a passenger compensation is claimed by a person other thanthe passenger, the carrier shall likewise be wholly or partly exoneratedfrom its liability to the extent that it proves that the damage was causedor contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful act or omission ofthat passenger. This Article applies to all the liability provisions in thisConvention, including paragraph 1 of Article 21.\nArticle 21 - Compensation in case of Death or Injury of\nPassengers\n1.
